In this example, the PaymentGateway, ShippingProvider, and TaxCalculator classes represent three external services that the web application needs to interact with. Each of these classes uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to the corresponding API endpoints and return the response as a JSON object.
The ExternalServicesFacade class creates instances of all three external services in its constructor and provides a single process_order method that encapsulates the logic of processing an order. This method calls the corresponding methods on each of the external services to process the payment, calculate the shipping cost, and calculate the tax amount. It then calculates the total amount and returns a dictionary containing all the relevant information.
The client code can create an instance of ExternalServicesFacade and call its process_order method to process an order using the three external services through a simplified interface. This makes it much easier for the client code to interact with the external
