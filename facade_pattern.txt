In this example, there are three subsystems (SubsystemA, SubsystemB, and SubsystemC), each with multiple methods. The Facade class again creates instances of all three subsystems in its constructor, but now it provides three different methods (operation1, operation2, and operation3) to access the functionalities of the subsystems. The operation1 method calls operation1 on all three subsystems, the operation2 method calls operation2 on all three subsystems, and the operation3 method calls operation3 on only SubsystemC. The client code can create an instance of Facade and call any of its methods to access the functionalities of the subsystems through a simplified interface.
